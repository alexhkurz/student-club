# README

A prototype implementation of a blockchain-based DApp for the decentralized governance of a student club.

1. First attempt: I tried [Polygon Edge](https://github.com/0xPolygon/polygon-edge.git) to create a local blockchain network with 3 validator nodes, see [`polygon-edge/README.md`](polygon-edge/README.md) for more information. I did run into some issues with deprecated software and while I could have continued, I looked for Hardhat as an alternative.
2. Second attempt: [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is a development environment to compile, deploy, test, and debug your smart contracts in Ethereum-like blockchains. See [`with-hardhat/README.md`](with-hardhat/README.md) for more information.
